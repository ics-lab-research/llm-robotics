"Given this URScript code snippet: `global my_variable = 10`, explain what the 'global' keyword means and how it affects the scope and accessibility of `my_variable`.","","In URScript, the `global` keyword declares a variable as existing in the global scope. This means:

1. **Scope:** The variable declared as global exists outside any specific function or subroutine. This makes it accessible from any part of the program, including inside functions.

2. **Accessibility:** Unlike local variables, declared within a function (which are only accessible inside that function), a global variable can be accessed and modified by any part of the script.

3. **Lifetime:** Global variables are initialized and remain accessible throughout the execution of the script, making them suitable for storing program-wide data or constants.

4. **Implications:** While making data globally available, use of global variables can make program harder to understand or debug: when a bug is encountered its origin could lie in any part of the script. Global variables affect the state more broadly than local variables and can hide implicit program behaviours.
