Here's a URScript program I wrote for controlling a Universal Robot arm. It picks up an object and places it at a specific location. Can you make the following improvements?
1. Add a feature to detect if the object isn't picked up and retry three times before stopping.
2. Add comments to explain each step of the process.
3. Optimize the loop structure for readability.
