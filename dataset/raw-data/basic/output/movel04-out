Here's a function in URscript that allow you to move UR robot between 2 waypoints linear in tool-space given tool position, using active TCP and blend radius to smoothen the robot's movement:

```URscript
def move_linear():
  local Waypoint_1_p=p[-0.13, -0.26, 0.14, -0.001, 3.11, 0.03] 
  local Waypoint_2_p=p[-0.008, -0.26, 0.28, -0.27, -2.71, 0.217] 

  while (True):
    movel(Waypoint_1_p, a=1.2, v=0.25, r=0.05)
	movel(Waypoint_2_p, a=0.78, v=0.87, r=0.06)
  end
end
```

### Explaination:
1. `Waypoint_1_p`: tool position or pose (x, y, x, Rx, Ry, Rz) of waypoint_1
2. `Waypoint_2_p`: tool position (x, y, x, Rx, Ry, Rz) of waypoint_2
3. `movel()`: command move robot to position linear in tool-space, given tool acceleration(a) and tool speed(v), blend radius (r)

You can modify the necessary parameters such as joint positions, or the velocity and acceleration of the movel() function.
